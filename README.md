Underbar

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor. This project was worked on with a pair.

Underbar is a utility library similar to Underscore.js or lodash.

Utils include:
- _.first
- _.last
- _.each
- _.indexOf
- _.filter
- _.uniq
- _.map
- _.pluck
- _.reduce
- _.contains
- _.every
- _.some
- _.extend
